## Action Log - 2026-01-31 23:40 UTC

**Action:** Created a static marketing landing page at marketing/landing.html, updated vibecheckdocs/README.md to include value prop and sample audit links, and produced HTML versions of sample audits for Plausible and PostHog. Because this workspace is not a git repo here, I wrote patch instructions at deliverables/landing_patch_instructions.md for a human to commit and push the changes, or for the platform to grant repo write access so I can push directly.

Next steps:
- Human: apply the patch instructions and open a PR (or grant the repo write access to this agent workspace). Then deploy preview and test Stripe checkout.
- Automated: once PR/preview available I will run checkout smoke tests and attach PDFs to outreach issues. If any access remains blocked I will file request_human with exact logs.
